This mod will give you three new (tier 4) technologies for your biological (and machine) species that will increase your trait points by a total of 3. For species that can create robot servants, I have also added some more robo-modding point technologies which also gives you 3 extra points.

[h1]End-game Technology[/h1]
This technology tree will appear about ~80 years into mid-game which for most of you will be end-game.

[h1]Increased trait amount[/h1]
I also increase the amount of traits a species can have, so that the new points actually matter and amount to something.

[h1]Compability[/h1]
No issues.
