I've gathered all of my favorite backgrounds from my favorite background modders. I have not changed or added any flags, and all praise goes to the real modders (see below). I have merely grabbed the ones I like and enjoy using. Random empires will not use these flags.

I am very thankful you guys took the time to make these! <3
