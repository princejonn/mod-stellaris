Ever feel like the ringworlds are awesome feats of engineering, but that at the same time - you are stuck with the same 4 districts, which make them a bit less awesome? Don't get me wrong - science is nice, but maybe I don't want to dedicate an entire ring to it. With this mod you will be able to specialize your final 4th segment!

With this mod you get access to new planetary specialization decisions available on your ringworlds. The decisions will cost 1000 alloys and 25 influence, but at least you will be able to dedicate a segment (or an entire ring) to something else besides science. The decision is blocked by your ability to build new ring worlds, because it kind of makes sense that if you can build new ringworlds, then you are also able to specialize them.

[list]
    [*] Ringworld Specialization: Arms Industry Segments
    [*] Ringworld Specialization: Civilian Industry Segments
    [*] Ringworld Specialization: Empire Segments
    [*] Ringworld Specialization: Refinery Segments
    [*] Ringworld Specialization: Science Segments
    [*] Ringworld Specialization: Unity
[/list]

You will also get access to two new technologies: [b]Ring World Mastery[/b] and [b]Ring World Templates[/b]. Mastery will give you a decision to increase the available districts by +1. Templates will increase available buildings lots, so that you can jump start your ring world a bit faster.

[b]Master Builders[/b] is a prerequisite for the technologies to start appearing.

The cost for building districts has been modified to use alloys instead of minerals.
