Unleashing the power of Megastructures!


[h1]Science Nexus + Galactic Wonders bug[/h1]
Fixed in this mod of course <3


[h1]Build more than one[/h1]
You can build more than one of these:
[list]
    [*] Dyson Sphere
    [*] Matter Decompressor
    [*] Mega Art Installation
    [*] Science Nexus
[/list]


[h1]Start construction on more planetoids[/h1]
Doesn't really make sense that you cannot build some structures around stars, and that some must be built around stars (Dyson and Matter excluded). Therefore you can build these on many more planetoids:
[list]
    [*] Mega Art Installation
    [*] Interstellar Assembly
    [*] Science Nexus
    [*] Sentry Array
    [*] Strategic Coordination Center
    [*] Mega Shipyard
[/list]


[h1]Incremental bonuses[/h1]
I have also changed some of the bonuses to ramp up a bit near the end, and stay low in the beginning o your construction. I feel it fits better with the narrative, that you're not really finished yet.


[h1]Makeshift Restoration[/h1]
After you unlock [b]Star Fortress[/b], you will also be able to start your repairs on megastructures within your borders. The repaired structure will give 50% of the Stage 1 counterpart, but at least you feel like you're getting something out of them earlier. Makeshift is available on the following:
[list]
    [*] Dyson Sphere
    [*] Matter Decompressor
    [*] Science Nexus
    [*] Sentry Array
    [*] Strategic Coordination Center
[/list]


[h1]Ringworlds[/h1]
Ever feel like the ringworlds are awesome feats of engineering, but that at the same time - you are stuck with the same 4 districts, which make them a bit less awesome? Don't get me wrong - science is nice, but maybe I don't want to dedicate an entire ring to it. With this mod you will be able to specialize your final 4th segment!

With this mod you get access to new planetary specialization decisions available on your ringworlds. The decisions will cost 1000 alloys and 25 influence, but at least you will be able to dedicate a segment (or an entire ring) to something else besides science. The decision is blocked by your ability to build new ring worlds, because it kind of makes sense that if you can build new ringworlds, then you are also able to specialize them.

[list]
    [*] Ringworld Specialization: Arms Industry Segments
    [*] Ringworld Specialization: Civilian Industry Segments
    [*] Ringworld Specialization: Empire Segments
    [*] Ringworld Specialization: Refinery Segments
    [*] Ringworld Specialization: Science Segments
    [*] Ringworld Specialization: Unity
[/list]

You will also get access to two new technologies: [b]Ring World Mastery[/b] and [b]Ring World Templates[/b]. Mastery will give you a decision to increase the available districts by +1. Templates will increase available buildings lots, so that you can jump start your ring world a bit faster.

[b]Master Builders[/b] is a prerequisite for the technologies to start appearing.

The cost for building districts has been modified to use alloys instead of minerals.


[h1]Master Builders Expanded[/h1]
Adds three new technologies which you can research after taking the Master Builders Ascension Perk which will enable you to build up to +6 extra megastructures at the same time.


[h1]Special Deposits[/h1]
Adding new "mining" deposits on top of the resource districts. They enable new buildings, and jobs where you will be able to produce the resource in your habitat. This brings a new level of strategy to your habitat placement, and actually makes it more worth it to place your habitat on top of those valuable resources. It comes at a cost of energy, minerals/consumer goods, pop job slot, and building slot, but it will be worth it!

New buildings are:
[list]
    [*] Alloy Recycling Yard
    [*] Dark Matter Laboratory
    [*] Living Metal Laboratory
    [*] Nanite Replicator
    [*] Zro Harvesters
[/list]

The cost for building districts has been modified to use alloys instead of minerals, since it kind of makes more sense.
