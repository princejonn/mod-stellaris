I've added all of my favorite species to a package. I have not created a single file in this mod. It's just a collection. I've just packaged them so that mod list doesn't grow insanely large.

The real mod authors (and heroes) are here:

[h1]Species[/h1]

[i]If I have missed adding any species mod to this link list I am truly sorry and I will fix if you just tell me where the original is![/i]
