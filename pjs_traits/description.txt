With this mod I am (slowly) adding species traits to the game. Please give me requests if there's something you're missing (and please find a good PNG for it if you can)

[h1]Adding more than 5 traits to your species[/h1]
You can get more than 5 traits per species from my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1442403409]Increased Maximum Traits[/url] mod.

[h1]Getting more trait points[/h1]
You can get this from my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1317108035]Trait Point Technologies[/url] mod.

[h1]Severed Nerves[/h1]
This is a special tech that gives you a trait with the same name. You can find the technology and trait in my  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1636790664]Nerve Stapled Technology[/url] mod.

[h1]Compability[/h1]
There should be no compability issues with this mod.

[h1]Recognition[/h1]
The idea for my Psionic trait comes from a previous mod, but I cannot remember which. I think it was a mod adding Asari, but there are quite a few of them now so I have no idea which. Kudos on whoever you are!
