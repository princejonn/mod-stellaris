   [*] Delta Pavonis
   [*] Ophiuchi
   [*] Tau Haruki

[h1]Arrakis[/h1]
I am not sure how to handle Arrakis properly in the new patch, so it's just currently a quite nice planet with some guaranteed motes and crystals and whatnot. Please give me your input, thoughts and ideas to this!

[h1]Upcoming[/h1]
[list]
    [*] Alkalurops IX should be a starting world for machine empires with unique buildings
    [*] Add a building to create Sardaukar on Salusa Secundus, and add multiple fortress buildings on Salusa Secundus to have Sardaukar defense armies
    [*] Add Chapterhouse system
    [*] Neighbour to Gieidi Prime with Planet Lankiveil (pc_arctic)
    [*] Arrakis is 3rd planet and has 2 moons.
