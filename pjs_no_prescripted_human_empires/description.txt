So you sit down to play on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1745185764]Holy Terra[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1265397942]Detailed Sol[/url], or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1745184778]Deneb Enhanced[/url] thinking you're gonna have a nice run as a Human, but suddenly the bug lords have decided that one Sol is not enough. You shall have one extra!

This can get fairly annoying, so when you want to make sure you don't get any prescripted humans you just activate this mod when you start your game, and then deactivate it when you want them back.

At least now you have the option.

(Of course this mod works with any other system, I just wanted to shamelessly plug my humanity system mods)
