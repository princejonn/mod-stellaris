Unleashing the power of Megastructures!

[h1]Science Nexus + Galactic Wonders bug[/h1]
Fixed in this mod of course <3

[h1]Build more than one[/h1]
You can build more than one of these:
[list]
    [*] Dyson Sphere
    [*] Matter Decompressor
    [*] Mega Art Installation
    [*] Science Nexus
[/list]

[h1]Start construction on more planetoids[/h1]
Doesn't really make sense that you cannot build some structures around stars, and that some must be built around stars (Dyson and Matter excluded). Therefore you can build these on many more planetoids:
[list]
    [*] Mega Art Installation
    [*] Interstellar Assembly
    [*] Science Nexus
    [*] Sentry Array
    [*] Strategic Coordination Center
[/list]

[h1]Incremental bonuses[/h1]
I have also changed some of the bonuses to ramp up a bit near the end, and stay low in the beginning o your construction. I feel it fits better with the narrative, that you're not really finished yet.

[h1]Makeshift Restoration[/h1]
After you unlock [b]Star Fortress[/b], you will also be able to start your repairs on megastructures within your borders. The repaired structure will give 50% of the Stage 1 counterpart, but at least you feel like you're getting something out of them earlier. Makeshift is available on the following:
[list]
    [*] Dyson Sphere
    [*] Matter Decompressor
    [*] Science Nexus
    [*] Sentry Array
    [*] Strategic Coordination Center
[/list]
