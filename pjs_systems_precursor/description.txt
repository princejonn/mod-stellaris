[h1]Extremely Overpowered Start[/h1]

Start as a precursor/awakened empire, emerging from stasis, and finding a new fledgling galaxy ready for your influence. You will have access to city, gaia, and ring worlds, as well as many megastructures.

If you start in this system you will have such an easy start, the game will probably be boring, unless you set difficulty to Grand Admiral and play it badly.

An alternative path is to gift this starting system to a nemesis, and take delight in the (probably pretty difficult task) of conquering your nemesis and claiming these systems as your own through hard-fought battle!
