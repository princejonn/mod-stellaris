This mod is based on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2010453617]Shut Up, We Don't Care![/url]. It's basically a 2.6 compatible version right now. Maybe I will silence some more actions that I don't care about in the future. It depends on how my tests go.

Once the original mod is updated to 2.6 I will probably remove this mod, so make sure to keep a good eye on AlphaAsh's mod!
