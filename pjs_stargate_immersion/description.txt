This mod adds the ability to uncover Stargates on your worlds. Stargates are powerful planetary gateways that will increase the possibility of pop movement in between your (and other) worlds.

By researching the three technologies you will get access to a planetary decision to uncover your very own stargate. This will add a modifier and a deposit with effects and jobs.

In the future I want to add some random spawning events for your empire if you have a stargate active, but we'll see what I'll have time for.
