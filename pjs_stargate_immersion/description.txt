[h1]Massively overhauled and improved for 2.6[/h1]

With this mod you will gain access to a decades long story line that will eventually give you access to the famous [b]Stargate[/b]. It will begin with a mysterious circle...

[i]Hints: [b]Wormhole[/b] and [b]Living Metal[/b] technologies have become extra interesting.[/i]

This mod will only work for non-gestalt empires right now. I think it fits the story, and I can't really be arsed making a full new storyline for gestalts as well. You will have to make do, and enjoy the mod when you're playing a regular empire.

[h1]Events[/h1]
With this mod, you will also [i](infrequently)[/i] gain resources from your [i](imaginary?)[/i] stargate teams.

If you have ideas for a story that a team will encounter, you are welcome to suggest it. Right now I will only accept some basic one-off events that give an immediate amount of resources (or none at all, just a cute story maybe?).
