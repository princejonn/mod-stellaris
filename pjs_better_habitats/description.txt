Habitats are in a [b]REALLY[/b] good place right now. The only thing I wanted to tweak is job numbers. All habitat districts get 6 jobs instead of 3, but have no housing, and the housing district adds 20 slots instead of 8.

[h1]Special Deposits[/h1]
Adding new "mining" deposits on top of the resource districts. They enable new buildings, and jobs where you will be able to produce the resource in your habitat. This brings a new level of strategy to your habitat placement, and actually makes it more worth it to place your habitat on top of those valuable resources. It comes at a cost of energy, minerals/consumer goods, pop job slot, and building slot, but it will be worth it!

New buildings are:
[list]
    [*] Alloy Recycling Yard
    [*] Dark Matter Laboratory
    [*] Living Metal Laboratory
    [*] Nanite Replicator
    [*] Zro Harvesters
[/list]

[h1]Mod order[/h1]
You will need to load this mod as far down as possible since it changes default files. This means if you have Planetary Diversity (like I do), you will have to load Planetary Diversity [b]ABOVE[/b] this mod.

[h1]Compability[/h1]
I overwrite the 03_habitat_districts file.
