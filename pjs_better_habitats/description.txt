Habitats are in a [b]REALLY[/b] good place right now. The only thing I wanted to tweak is job numbers. All habitat districts get 5 jobs instead of 3, and the housing district adds 10 slots.

[h1]Special Deposits[/h1]
I have replaced the alloy, dark matter, living metal, nanite, and zro deposits with new "mining" deposits. They enable new buildings, and jobs where you will be able to produce the resource in your habitat. This brings a new level of strategy to your habitat placement, and actually makes it more worth it to place your habitat on top of those valuable resources. It comes at a cost of energy, minerals/consumer goods, pop job slot, and building slot, but it will be worth it!

New buildings are:
[list]
    [*] Alloy Recycling Yard
    [*] Dark Matter Laboratory
    [*] Living Metal Laboratory
    [*] Nanite Replicator
    [*] Zro Harvesters
[/list]

Do you have ideas on how to make habitats even better? Please share in the comment section below.

I overwrite the 03_habitat_districts file.
